<h1> What is Tsunami</h1>
A tsunami is a series of ocean waves with extremely long wavelengths and periods, caused by a large and sudden displacement of water. This displacement is usually the result of an underwater earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, or meteorite impact. Tsunamis can travel across entire ocean basins, causing widespread destruction when they reach shorelines.
<h1> Do Tsunamis Happen?</h1>

<h2>Tsunamis are typically triggered by:</h2>
1. Underwater Earthquakes: The most common cause. When tectonic plates shift abruptly at subduction zones, they displace a large volume of water.
<br>
2. Volcanic Eruptions: Explosive eruptions or the collapse of volcanic structures can displace water.
<br>
3. Landslides: Large volumes of rock and debris falling into the ocean or shifting underwater can create waves.
<br>
4. Meteorite Impacts: Rare but can cause significant water displacement and tsunami waves.
<br>
<h1>The Strongest Tsunami in the Philippines</h1>

One of the most devastating tsunamis in the Philippines occurred on August 17, 1976, triggered by a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in the Moro Gulf. The resulting tsunami struck the southern part of Mindanao, particularly affecting the regions around the Gulf of Moro, leading to thousands of deaths and widespread destruction.

<h1>Areas Affected by Tsunamis in the Philippines</h1>

The Philippines, being an archipelago located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, is particularly vulnerable to tsunamis. Coastal areas along the eastern seaboard facing the Pacific Ocean are at higher risk, including:
<br>- Eastern Mindanao (Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur)
<br>- Eastern Visayas (Samar, Leyte)
<br>- Bicol Region (Albay, Sorsogon)
<br>- Northern Luzon (Cagayan, Isabela)

<h1>Types of Tsunamis: Causes, Characteristics, and Affected Areas</h1>

<br>1. Local Tsunamis
<br>- Causes: Nearby underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides.
<br>- Characteristics: These tsunamis arrive within minutes of the triggering event and can cause severe local damage.
<br>- Affected Areas: Coastal regions close to the epicenter or source of displacement.

<br>2. Regional Tsunamis
<br>- Causes: Larger underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.
<br>- Characteristics: These tsunamis can affect coastlines within a range of about 1000 kilometers from the source.
<br>- Affected Areas: Wider regional coastal areas, often with a lead time of several minutes to hours.

<br>3. Distant (Tele-) Tsunamis
   <br>  - Causes: Major seismic events occurring far from affected coastlines.
   <br>- Characteristics: These tsunamis travel across entire ocean basins and can take hours to reach distant shores.
   <br>- Affected Areas: Coastal areas far from the seismic activity, providing more time for evacuation.

<h1>Tips and Guidelines to Prevent and Prepare for Tsunamis</h1>

<h2>Prevention and Preparedness</h2>
<br> - Early Warning Systems: Establish and maintain tsunami detection and warning systems.
<br> - Education and Drills: Educate communities about tsunami risks and conduct regular evacuation drills.
<br> - Zoning and Land Use Planning: Avoid building critical infrastructure and residences in high-risk areas.
<br> - Natural Barriers: Preserve and restore natural barriers such as mangroves and coral reefs which can reduce the impact of waves.
<br> - Emergency Kits: Prepare emergency kits with essentials like water, food, medications, and important documents.

<h1>Safety Measures to Follow</h1>

<h2>Before a Tsunami</h2>
<br> - Stay Informed: Pay attention to local warnings and alerts.
<br> - Know Evacuation Routes: Be familiar with the nearest evacuation routes and higher ground locations.
<br> - Plan with Family: Ensure all family members know the plan and designated meeting points.

<h2>During a Tsunami</h2>
<br>- Evacuate Immediately: If you feel an earthquake or hear a tsunami warning, move to higher ground immediately.
<br>- Avoid the Coastline: Do not go to the shore to watch the waves.
<br>- Follow Instructions: Adhere to instructions from local authorities and emergency services.

<h2>After a Tsunami</h2>
<br>- Wait for the All Clear: Do not return to the affected areas until authorities declare it safe.
<br>- Be Cautious of Hazards: Watch out for debris, weakened structures, and contaminated water.
<br>- Assist Others: Help those in need and cooperate with rescue and relief operations.
