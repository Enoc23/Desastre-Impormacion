      <h1>What is a Tornado?</h1>

A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. They are characterized by a funnel-shaped cloud and can cause extensive damage due to their high winds and intense pressure differentials.
<h1>How Do Tornadoes Happen?</h1>

<br> Tornadoes typically form under the following conditions:
<br> 1. Thunderstorms: Tornadoes usually develop from severe thunderstorms, particularly supercell storms which have a rotating updraft called a mesocyclone.
<br> 2. Wind Shear: Changes in wind speed and direction at different altitudes create horizontal spinning effects in the atmosphere.
<br> 3. Updraft: Rising warm, moist air can tilt this horizontally spinning air to a vertical position, leading to the formation of a tornado.
<br> 4. Condensation Funnel: As the rotating air draws in more warm air and cools, it may form a visible funnel cloud.

<h1>The Strongest Tornado in the Philippines</h1>

The Philippines does not experience tornadoes as frequently as places like the United States, but tornadoes do occur. One of the notable tornado events was in August 2013 in Barangay San Miguel, Iloilo, which destroyed several homes. 
The tornado was reported to have wind speeds of around 180 kilometers per hour (equivalent to an EF2 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale).

<h1>Areas Affected by Tornadoes in the Philippines</h1>

<br>Tornadoes can occur throughout the Philippines but are more commonly reported in the following areas:
<br> - Luzon: Including Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and Northern Luzon.
<br> - Visayas: Particularly in the Western and Central regions.
<br> - Mindanao: Southern regions are also prone but less frequently.

Tornadoes in the Philippines often occur during the rainy season, especially in association with thunderstorms and typhoons.

 <h1>Types of Tornadoes: Causes, Characteristics, and Affected Areas</h1>

 <br> 1. Weak Tornadoes (EF0 - EF1)
   <br> - Causes: Often associated with small thunderstorms or weather fronts.
   <br> - Characteristics: Wind speeds of 65-110 mph (105-177 km/h), causing minor to moderate damage.
   <br> - Affected Areas: Can occur anywhere but typically less widespread and short-lived.

<br> 2. Strong Tornadoes (EF2 - EF3)
<br>- Causes: Associated with more organized and powerful supercell thunderstorms.
<br>- Characteristics: Wind speeds of 111-165 mph (178-266 km/h), causing considerable to severe damage.
<br>- Affected Areas: More likely in areas with severe thunderstorms, such as the central regions of the Philippines.

<br>3. Violent Tornadoes (EF4 - EF5)
<br>   - Causes: Result from very powerful and sustained supercell thunderstorms.
<br>   - Characteristics: Wind speeds exceeding 166 mph (267 km/h), causing devastating to incredible damage.
<br>   - Affected Areas: Extremely rare in the Philippines, but possible during severe weather events.

 <h1>Tips and Guidelines to Prevent and Prepare for Tornadoes</h1>

 <h2>Prevention and Preparedness</h2>
 <br>- Early Warning Systems: Implement and maintain systems to detect and alert about tornadoes.
 <br>- Community Education: Raise awareness and educate the public on recognizing tornado signs and safety protocols.
 <br>- Construction Standards: Build structures to withstand high winds, especially in tornado-prone areas.
 <br>- Emergency Kits: Prepare kits with essentials such as food, water, medications, and important documents.

 <h2>Safety Measures to Follow</h2>

 <h2>Before a Tornado</h2>
 <br>- Stay Informed: Monitor weather forecasts and alerts.
 <br>- Safe Room: Identify a safe room or storm shelter in your home, such as a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor.
 <br>- Family Plan: Ensure all family members know the plan and designated meeting points.
 <br>- Secure Property: Remove or secure outdoor objects that could become projectiles.

 <h2>During a Tornado</h2>
- Seek Shelter: Go to your pre-designated safe room. If outside, find the nearest sturdy building or lie flat in a ditch, covering your head.
- Avoid Windows: Stay away from windows and cover yourself with a mattress or heavy blankets if possible.
- Protect Your Head: Use a helmet, if available, or your arms to shield your head from debris.

 <h2>After a Tornado</h2>
- Wait for the All Clear: Do not leave your shelter until it is safe.
- Be Cautious of Hazards: Watch out for debris, downed power lines, and weakened structures.
- Assist Others: Help those in need and cooperate with rescue and relief operations.
- Listen to Authorities: Follow instructions from local authorities and emergency services.
