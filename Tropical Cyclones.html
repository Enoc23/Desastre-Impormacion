<h1>What are Tropical Cyclones?</h1>

Tropical cyclones are intense circular storms that originate over warm tropical oceans. They are characterized by low atmospheric pressure, strong winds, and heavy rain. Depending on their location and strength, they are called hurricanes, typhoons, or simply cyclones.

<h1>How Do Tropical Cyclones Happen?</h1>

<br>Tropical cyclones form through the following process:
<br>1. Warm Ocean Water: The sea surface temperature must be at least 26.5°C (80°F) to a depth of about 50 meters (160 feet).
<br>2. Coriolis Effect: This is necessary to create the cyclonic rotation; it is absent at the equator and becomes stronger with latitude.
<br>3. Low Atmospheric Pressure: A pre-existing weather disturbance, often in the form of a tropical wave, provides a focal point for the storm.
<br>4. Moist Air: Moist air rising from the ocean surface cools and condenses, releasing latent heat, which fuels the storm.
<br>5. Wind Shear: Low vertical wind shear allows the storm to develop vertically without being torn apart.

<h1>The Strongest Tropical Cyclone in the Philippines</h1>

Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Yolanda) is the strongest recorded tropical cyclone to have made landfall in the Philippines. It struck in November 2013 with maximum sustained winds of 195 mph (315 km/h) and caused catastrophic damage, especially in the Eastern Visayas region. It resulted in thousands of deaths and widespread destruction.

<h1> Areas Affected by Tropical Cyclones in the Philippines</h1>

<br>The Philippines is highly susceptible to tropical cyclones due to its geographic location in the western Pacific Ocean. Key areas often affected include:
<br>- Eastern Visayas: First to be hit by typhoons coming from the Pacific.
<br>- Luzon: Particularly Northern and Central Luzon, which frequently experience landfalling typhoons.
<br>- Mindanao: While less frequent, Mindanao can still be affected, particularly the northeastern areas.

<h1>Types of Tropical Cyclones, Causes, Characteristics, and Affected Areas</h1>

<br>1. Tropical Depression:
<br>   - Causes: Low-pressure system with organized thunderstorms but no significant wind circulation.
<br>   - Characteristics: Maximum sustained winds of less than 39 mph (63 km/h).
<br>   - Affected Areas: Coastal and inland areas, usually causing heavy rains and localized flooding.

<br>2. Tropical Storm:
<br>   - Causes: Strengthening of a tropical depression.
<br>   - Characteristics: Sustained winds between 39-73 mph (63-118 km/h).
<br>   - Affected Area: Coastal regions and further inland, potentially causing significant rainfall and moderate wind damage.

<br>3. Typhoon:
<br>   - Causes: Further intensification of a tropical storm.
<br>   - Characteristics: Sustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher.
<br>   - Affected Areas: Wide areas including coastal and inland regions, with potential for severe wind damage, heavy rain, and storm surges.

<br>4. Super Typhoon:
<br>   - Causes: Extreme intensification of a typhoon.
<br>   - Characteristics**: Sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) or higher.
<br>   - Affected Areas**: Extensive regions with catastrophic wind damage, torrential rains, and life-threatening storm surges.

<h1>Tips and Guidelines to Prevent and Prepare for Tropical Cyclones</h1>

<h2>Prevention and Mitigation:**</h2>
- Building Codes: Implement and enforce strict building codes designed to withstand strong winds and flooding.
- Coastal Defenses: Construct seawalls, levees, and other defenses to protect against storm surges.
- Reforestation: Maintain and restore mangroves and other natural barriers.

</h2>Preparation:</h2>
- Emergency Kits: Prepare emergency kits with essential supplies such as food, water, medications, and important documents.
- Evacuation Plans: Develop and practice evacuation plans, especially for those living in low-lying or coastal areas.
- Stay Informed: Monitor weather reports and heed warnings from authorities.

<h2>Safety Measures Before, During, and After a Tropical Cyclone</h2>

<h2>Before a Tropical Cyclone:</h2>
<br>- Secure Property: Board up windows, secure outdoor objects, and reinforce structures.
<br>- Emergency Supplies: Ensure you have a supply of non-perishable food, clean water, and other necessities.
<br>- Evacuate if Necessary: Follow evacuation orders from local authorities.

<h2>During a Tropical Cyclone:**</h2>
- Stay Indoors: Remain inside a secure building, away from windows and doors.
- Listen to Updates: Keep informed through a battery-powered radio or mobile device.
- Avoid Floodwaters: Do not attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters.

<h2>After a Tropical Cyclone:</h2>
- Wait for Clearance: Only return home when authorities declare it safe.
- Inspect for Damage: Check for structural damage, gas leaks, and electrical issues.
- Clean Up Safely: Use protective gear and be cautious of debris and contaminated water.
