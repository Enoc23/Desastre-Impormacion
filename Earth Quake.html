<p class="paragraph">   <h1>What is an Earthquake?</h1>

   An earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere. This release of energy generates seismic waves, which can result in significant ground shaking and potential damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the natural landscape.
   
   <h1>How Do Earthquakes Happen?</h1>
   
   Earthquakes occur primarily due to the movement of tectonic plates. The Earth's crust is divided into several large and small plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These plates are constantly moving, and when they 
   interact at their boundaries, they can become locked due to friction. When the stress on the boundary overcomes this friction, the plates slip suddenly, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves. These interactions can occur at:
   
   <br> 1. Divergent Boundaries: Where plates move apart.
   <br> 2. Convergent Boundaries: Where plates move towards each other.
   <br> 3. Transform Boundaries: Where plates slide past each other horizontally.
   
   <h1>The Strongest Earthquake in the Philippines</h1>
   
   The strongest recorded earthquake in the Philippines occurred on August 16, 1976, known as the Moro Gulf Earthquake. It had a magnitude of 7.9 and was followed by a devastating tsunami, resulting in significant loss of life and property.
   
 <h1>Fault Lines in the Philippines and Affected Areas</h1>
   
  <br> The Philippines is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, making it highly susceptible to earthquakes. Key fault lines include:
   
   <br> 1. Marikina Valley Fault System (West and East Valley Faults): Runs through Metro Manila and surrounding provinces.
   <br> 2. Philippine Fault Zone: Extends from Luzon to Mindanao.
   <br> 3. Valley Fault System: A major fault system in Luzon.
   
   Areas near these fault lines, such as Metro Manila, Northern Luzon, and parts of Mindanao, are particularly at risk.
   
   <h1>Types of Earthquakes</h1>
 <br> 1. Tectonic Earthquakes:
<br> - Causes: Movement of tectonic plates.
<br> - Characteristics: Most common and usually the most destructive.
 <br> - Affected Areas: Regions along plate boundaries.
   
 <br> 2. Volcanic Earthquakes:
 <br> - Causes: Magma movement beneath volcanoes.
 <br>  - Characteristics: Often precede or accompany volcanic eruptions.
 <br>  - Affected Areas: Volcanic regions.
   
 <br> 3. Collapse Earthquakes:
 <br>  - Causes: Cavern or mine collapse.
 <br>  - Characteristics: Localized and smaller in magnitude.
 <br>  - Affected Areas: Areas with extensive mining or large underground cavities.
   
 <br> 4. Explosion Earthquakes:
 <br> - Causes: Explosions from nuclear or chemical devices.
 <br> - Characteristics: Human-induced and can be significant locally.
 <br> - Affected Areas: Areas around explosion sites.
   
                           <h1>Tips and Guidelines on How to Prepare for Earthquakes</h1>
   
   
<h2>Before an Earthquake</h2>
   
<br> 1. Prepare an Emergency Kit: Include water, food, medications, flashlight, batteries, and important documents.
<br> 2. Develop a Family Emergency Plan: Ensure everyone knows how to respond during an earthquake.
<br> 3. Secure Heavy Items: Fasten furniture, appliances, and other heavy objects to walls.
<br> 4. Retrofit Buildings: Strengthen older buildings to withstand seismic activity.
   
 <h2>During an Earthquake</h2>
   
 <br> 1. Drop, Cover, and Hold On: Drop to your hands and knees, take cover under a sturdy table or desk, and hold on until shaking stops.
 <br> 2. Stay Indoors: Avoid windows, exterior walls, and doorways.
 <br> 3. If Outdoors: Move to an open area away from buildings, trees, and power lines.
 <br> 4. If in a Vehicle: Pull over to a safe location and remain inside until the shaking stops.
   
 <h2>After an Earthquake</h2>
   
 <br>   1. Check for Injuries and Damage: Provide first aid and check for hazards like gas leaks or structural damage.
 <br>   2. Follow Emergency Services Instructions: Listen to the radio or authorities for updates and instructions.
 <br>   3. Avoid Damaged Areas: Stay away from buildings and infrastructure that may have been weakened.
 <br>   4. Be Prepared for Aftershocks: These can follow the main quake and cause additional damage.
