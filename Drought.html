        <h1> What is Drought?</h1>

A drought is an extended period of deficient rainfall relative to the statistical multi-year average for a region. It results in water shortages that affect the environment, agriculture, human health, and the economy. 

<h1>How Does Drought Happen?</h1>

Droughts occur due to a combination of natural and human factors:
<br>Meteorological Factors: Prolonged periods of low precipitation, which can be influenced by atmospheric conditions like high-pressure systems that prevent cloud formation.
<br>Hydrological Factors: Reduced water availability in rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater supplies due to lack of rainfall and increased evaporation rates.
<br>-Agricultural Factors: Soil moisture deficits that impact crop growth and water availability for livestock.
<br> - Human Factors: Overuse and mismanagement of water resources, deforestation, and climate change exacerbate the natural occurrences of drought.

<h1>The Strongest Drought in the Philippines</h1>

One of the most severe droughts in the Philippines occurred during the 2015-2016 El Ni√±o event. This phenomenon significantly reduced rainfall, leading to widespread agricultural damage, water shortages, and disruptions in electricity supply due to the reliance on hydroelectric power.

<h1>Areas Affected by Drought in the Philippines</h1>

<br> Drought in the Philippines typically affects:
<br> - Luzon: Particularly Central Luzon and Metro Manila, due to high population density and water demand.
<br> - Visayas: Including Eastern Visayas and parts of Western and Central Visayas.
<br> - Mindanao: Particularly in agricultural areas like North Cotabato and Davao del Sur.

<h1>Types of Drought, Causes, Characteristics, and Affected Areas</h1>

<br> 1. Meteorological Drought:
<br> - Causes: Below-average precipitation.
<br> - Characteristics: Reduced rainfall, increased temperature, and altered wind patterns.
<br> - Affected Areas: Can occur anywhere, but regions like Central Luzon and Mindanao are particularly vulnerable.

<br> 2. Agricultural Drought:
<br> - Causes: Insufficient soil moisture to meet the needs of crops.
<br> - Characteristics: Poor crop yield, reduced soil fertility, and stunted plant growth.
<br> - Affected Areas: Predominantly agricultural regions such as Central Luzon, Western Visayas, and Mindanao.

<br> 3. Hydrological Drought:
   <br> - Causes: Decreased water levels in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs.
   <br> - Characteristics: Lowered water supply for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use.
   <br> - Affected Areas: Areas dependent on surface water and groundwater, including urban centers like Metro Manila.

   <br> 4. Socioeconomic Drought:
   <br> - Causes: A combination of the above factors leading to a supply-demand mismatch.
   <br> - Characteristics: Economic losses, food and water scarcity, and public health issues.
   <br> - Affected Areas: Broad regions where agricultural and economic activities are heavily impacted, such as Luzon and Mindanao.

<h1>Tips and Guidelines to Prevent and Prepare for Drought</h1>

<h2>Prevention:</h2>
<br> - Water Conservation: Implement water-saving techniques in households, industries, and agriculture.
<br> - Sustainable Practices: Adopt sustainable farming practices like crop rotation and the use of drought-resistant crops.
<br> - Afforestation: Plant trees to enhance the water cycle and reduce evaporation.

<br><h2>Preparation:</h2>
<br> - Water Storage: Build and maintain reservoirs and rainwater harvesting systems.
<br> - Drought Planning: Develop drought contingency plans at local and national levels.
<br> - Early Warning Systems: Use meteorological data to predict and monitor drought conditions.

<h1>Safety Measures Before, During, and After a Drought </h1>

<br><h2>Before a Drought:</h2>
<br> - Educate the Community: Raise awareness about water conservation and drought preparedness.
<br> - Infrastructure: Improve water infrastructure to reduce leaks and waste.
<br> - Emergency Plans: Establish clear protocols for water rationing and relief distribution.

<br><h2>During a Drought:</h2>
<br> - Water Restrictions: Enforce water usage restrictions for non-essential activities.
<br> - Support Farmers: Provide assistance to farmers through subsidies, alternative crops, and efficient irrigation methods.
<br> - Health Measures: Ensure adequate hydration and sanitation to prevent health issues.

<br><h2>After a Drought:</h2>
<br>- Recovery Programs: Implement programs to restore affected ecosystems and support economic recovery.
<br>- Water Management Review: Assess and improve water management practices to better prepare for future droughts.
<br>- Community Support: Offer psychological and financial support to those severely affected by the drought.
