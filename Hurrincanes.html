<h1>What are Hurricanes?</h1>

Hurricanes are powerful tropical cyclones with sustained winds exceeding 74 mph (119 km/h). They form over warm ocean waters and can cause significant damage through strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and flooding. Hurricanes are known as typhoons in the Northwest Pacific and cyclones in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.

<h1>How Do Hurricanes Happen?</h1>

<br>  Hurricanes develop through the following process:
<br>  1. Warm Ocean Water: Sea surface temperatures of at least 26.5°C (80°F) to a depth of about 50 meters (160 feet) provide the necessary heat and moisture.
<br>  2. Atmospheric Disturbance: A pre-existing weather disturbance, such as a tropical wave, initiates the development of a low-pressure system.
<br>  3. Coriolis Effect: The rotation of the Earth induces a cyclonic rotation, which is necessary for the storm's development.
<br>  4. Low Wind Shear: Minimal vertical wind shear allows the storm to develop vertically and strengthens the cyclone.
<br>  5. Moisture in the Mid-Troposphere: High humidity in the middle levels of the troposphere is crucial for sustaining convection and development.

<h1>The Strongest Hurricanes in the Philippines</h1>

The term "hurricane" is not used in the Philippines; instead, such storms are referred to as typhoons. The strongest recorded typhoon to hit the Philippines is Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013. With sustained winds of 195 mph (315 km/h), it caused catastrophic damage, especially in the Eastern Visayas region.

<h1> Areas Affected by Hurricanes in the Philippines</h1>

<br>  The Philippines is frequently affected by typhoons due to its location in the western Pacific Ocean. Key areas often affected include:
<br> - Eastern Visayas: The first area to be impacted by typhoons from the Pacific.
<br> - Luzon: Especially Northern and Central Luzon, which are frequently in the path of strong typhoons.
<br> - Mindanao: Though less frequently hit, Mindanao can still experience typhoons, particularly in the northeastern parts.

<h1>Types of Tropical Cyclones, Causes, Characteristics, and Affected Areas</h1>

<br>1. Tropical Depression:
   <br>  - Causes: Formed from a cluster of thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation.
   <br>  - Characteristics: Maximum sustained winds of less than 39 mph (63 km/h).
   <br>  - Affected Areas: Coastal and inland areas, usually causing heavy rain and localized flooding.

   <br>2. Tropical Storm:
   <br> - Causes: Strengthening of a tropical depression.
   <br> - Characteristics: Sustained winds between 39-73 mph (63-118 km/h).
   <br> - Affected Areas: Coastal regions and further inland, potentially causing significant rainfall and moderate wind damage.

   <br>  3. Typhoon (Hurricane):
   <br>  - Causes: Further intensification of a tropical storm.
   <br>  - Characteristics: Sustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher.
   <br>  - Affected Areas: Wide areas including coastal and inland regions, with potential for severe wind damage, heavy rain, and storm surges.

   <br> 4. Super Typhoon:
   <br>   - Causes: Extreme intensification of a typhoon.
   <br>   - Characteristics: Sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) or higher.
   <br>   - Affected Areas: Extensive regions with catastrophic wind damage, torrential rains, and life-threatening storm surges.

<h1> Tips and Guidelines to Prevent and Prepare for Hurricanes</h1>

<h2>Prevention and Mitigation:</h2>
<br> - Building Codes: Implement and enforce strict building codes designed to withstand strong winds and flooding.
<br> - Coastal Defenses: Construct seawalls, levees, and other defenses to protect against storm surges.
<br> - Reforestation: Maintain and restore mangroves and other natural barriers.

<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<br> - Emergency Kits: Prepare emergency kits with essential supplies such as food, water, medications, and important documents.
<br> - Evacuation Plans: Develop and practice evacuation plans, especially for those living in low-lying or coastal areas.
<br> - Stay Informed: Monitor weather reports and heed warnings from authorities.

<h2>Safety Measures Before, During, and After a Hurricane</h2>

<h2>Before a Hurricane:</h2>
<br>- Secure Property: Board up windows, secure outdoor objects, and reinforce structures.
<br>- Emergency Supplies: Ensure you have a supply of non-perishable food, clean water, and other necessities.
<br>- Evacuate if Necessary: Follow evacuation orders from local authorities.

<h2>During a Hurricane:</h2>
<br> - Stay Indoors: Remain inside a secure building, away from windows and doors.
<br> - Listen to Updates: Keep informed through a battery-powered radio or mobile device.
<br> - Avoid Floodwaters: Do not attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters.

<h2>After a Hurricane:</h2>
<br> - Wait for Clearance: Only return home when authorities declare it safe.
<br> - Inspect for Damage: Check for structural damage, gas leaks, and electrical issues.
<br> - Clean Up Safely: Use protective gear and be cautious of debris and contaminated water.
